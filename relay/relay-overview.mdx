Relay is an App and an API that enable instant, low-cost bridging, swapping, and cross-chain calling. **The API allows a user to pay for transactions on any chain with currency on any other chain.** Additionally, the API aggregates swap routes across chains, meaning user can pay for for swaps and cross-chain transactions by leveraging the best available liquidity directly via the API.

Relay is designed for both _same-chain and cross-chain excecution_, and leverages the [Relay Protocol](https://docs.relay.link/how-it-works/relay-protocol) to minimize gas costs and execution latency across chains. The speed and low cost makes the API ideal for price & time sensitive applications, such as payments, bridging, nft minting and gas abstraction, and cross-chain swaps.

Relay features the following key properties:

- **Fast**: Cross-chain transactions confirm in seconds.
- **Cheap**: The Relay Protocol is designed to reduce gas and capital costs, meaning the best possible price for users.
- **Chain-extensible**: Relay is designed to be easily extensible to any new chain. We currently support Bitcoin, Solana, and 44+ EVM chains, including appchains.

## How to Use Relay

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Using the Relay API/SDK">
    You can use the Relay API, SDK, and Hooks to integrate Relay directly into your app or wallet. Explore our API docs [here](https://docs.relay.link/references/api/overview). The following code shows a sample of how to fetch a quote from the Relay SDK:

    <CodeGroup>

```typescript sdk
import { getClient } from "@reservoir0x/relay-sdk";
import { useWalletClient } from "wagmi";

const { data: wallet } = useWalletClient();

const quote = await getClient()?.actions.getQuote({
  wallet,
  chainId: 1, // The chain id to bridge from
  toChainId: 7777777, // The chain id to bridge to
  amount: "100000000000000000", // Amount in wei to bridge
  currency: "0x0000000000000000000000000000", // ERC20 Address
  toCurrency: "0x0000000000000000000000000000", // ERC20 Address
  tradeType: "EXACT_INPUT",
});
```

```typescript hooks
import { useRelayClient } from "@reservoir0x/relay-kit-ui";
import { useQuote } from "@reservoir0x/relay-kit-hooks";
import { useWalletClient } from "wagmi";

const { data: wallet } = useWalletClient();
const relayClient = useRelayClient();

const {
  data: quote,
  isLoading,
  error,
  executeQuote,
} = useQuote(relayClient, wallet, {
  originChainId: 1, // The chain id to bridge from
  destinationChainId: 7777777, // The chain id to bridge to
  amount: "100000000000000000", // Amount in wei to bridge
  originCurrency: "0x0000000000000000000000000000", // ERC20 Address
  destinationCurrency: "0x0000000000000000000000000000", // ERC20 Address
  tradeType: "EXACT_INPUT",
});
```

<Accordion title="Deeplinking to the Relay App">
  You can leverage the Relay App as a developer by using deep links. You can
  find our guide for deep linking to chains and tokens in the Relay App
  [here](https://docs.relay.link/guides/deep-linking).
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Get Relay on my Chain">
    You can view our currently supported chains [here](https://docs.relay.link/resources/supported-chains). If you would like Relay to support your chain, please [reach out](https://docs.relay.link/resources/supported-chains).
