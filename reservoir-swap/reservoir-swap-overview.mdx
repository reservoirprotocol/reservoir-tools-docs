**Reservoir Swap is a comprehensive & full-stack DEX solution for your chain.** The product offers a complete suite of tools and features, including:

- Canonical Uniswap V2 & V3 Contract Deployments
- Swap / Pool User Interface
- Routing API
- Subgraph Hosting
- SDKs (coming soon)

Together these tools provide a full-stack solution for developers to build liquid and sustainable token markets on any chain, including app chains.

## Why Canonical Uniswap?

Reservoir Swap uses the Uniswap Protocol to bring best-in-class AMM functionality to any EVM-compatible chain. Instead of forking Uniswap, Reservoir Swap facilitates the deployment of the canonical, DAO-governed version of Uniswap across chains. Our team collaborates closely with the Uniswap Foundation and Uniswap Accountability Committee to ensure all deployments adhere to proper governance procedures. With a strong focus on efficiency, deployments can be completed in less than a week, ensuring Day 1 availability. This means verified, secure, and time tested contracts on your chain.
