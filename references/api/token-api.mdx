The **Reservoir Swap Token API** includes ERC-20 token metadata, ownership data, Activity data, market data, and more.

Currently the API and data syncing is only available to enterprise customers. If you are interested in this data please [reach out](https://docs.relay.link/references/api/overview).

<Note>
  If you are interested in a **same chain and cross-chain swap API**, we
  recommend you use the Relay API. You can learn more about swaps using Relay
  [here](https://docs.relay.link/references/api/overview).
